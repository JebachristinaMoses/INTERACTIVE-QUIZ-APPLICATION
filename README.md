#With the help of tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,  I have created an interactive and engaging quiz experience for users.
structured the content with HTML.
styled the application with CSS.
added interactivity with JavaScript.
Added elements for the quiz container, question text, answer options, and feedback messages in html.
Created a CSS file to style the quiz elements.
Used JavaScript to display questions, capture user input, and provide feedback

 How the Application Works

1. The quiz starts by displaying the first question.

2. Users select an answer by clicking a button.

3. JavaScript checks the selected answer against the correct answer.

4. Feedback is given instantly
